This built-in Python module allows you to work with Comma-Separated Values (CSV) files.
The script uses csv to save the extracted job data in a CSV format (job_data.csv).
The code snippet with open('job_data.csv', 'w', newline='', encoding='utf-8') as csv_file: opens the CSV file for writing, sets newline handling, and specifies the character encoding.
Later, writer.writerow(job) writes each job entry as a row in the CSV file.
3. json

Another built-in Python module used for working with JSON data.
The script uses json to save the extracted job data in a JSON format (job_data.json).
The code snippet with open('job_data.json', 'w') as json_file: opens the JSON file for writing.
Later, json.dump(job_data, json_file, indent=4) dumps the retrieved data (stored in the job_data variable) into the JSON file with proper indentation for readability.

# In summary:

requests fetches data from the API.
csv creates and writes the data to a CSV file.
json creates and writes the data to a JSON file.
